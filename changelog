0.5.2:
- Change DIBL calculation mathod.

0.5.1:
- Altered substract influence calculation form from height (H2) to substract potential (phisB);
- Added  (Cbox) and altered silicon charge (Qsi) to use it;
- Change (2*H+W) to Wox in all code;
- Altered order of calculation, calculating capacitance before substract influence;
- Altered the corner capacitance effect to a paramenter and change the default to 2.5;
- Removed pow function from integer power calculation;
- Updated  code to use thermical potencial (fit) instead of (`P_Q/(`P_K*T)).

0.5:
- Removed channel lenght modulation effect (Leff);
- Removed effective Source/Drain Voltage (Vdseff);
- Remove transversal mobility degradation;
- Altered the constants for charge calculations (Qcs and Qcd);
- Altered from 2 functions to 1 in suavization fuction for charge calculations (Qcs and Qcd);
- Removed limln function;
- Changed from a single potential of source to source and drain pottential in DIBL;

0.4.1:
- First release.
